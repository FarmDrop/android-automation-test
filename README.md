Welcome to the farmdrop technical test for automation testers
Please spend no more than two hours on the following task. You are not expected to finish all of it - this is as much to understand how you approach things as it is to see if you can build working tests.

Background
Farmdrop sometimes uses a staging site at https://staging-web.farmdrop.com to run integration tests. The database is reset periodically and the payments system is connected to a sandbox, so you can experiment freely. Provided android build is connected to this staging environment. 



Task
Please build a suite of tests for the signup functionality of the provided apk. 

Write out a series of scenarios as a Cucumber feature file(s). Try to think from a regression perspective and come up with as many scenarios as you feel are appropriate in order to make sure this form is fully tested.
Begin to automate your scenarios and continue until your allocated time runs out. Use Cucumber/Ruby/appium/Calabash and any other gems/frameworks you feel are appropriate.

Notes
Code reuse is important to us, so we are interested in seeing what approaches you take to keep your code and tests modular.
Your submission should include instructions on how to run it.


Submission

Please fork this repository and commit code to it. Send us the link to your repo in an email.

Good Luck!!!
